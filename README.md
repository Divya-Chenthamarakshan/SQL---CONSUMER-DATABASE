The dataset contains 3,900 entries with details about customer shopping behavior. It includes
information like customer age, gender, and location, along with what they bought, how much they
spent, and their preferred product size, color, and season. It also tracks feedback ratings,

experience, while Sales Performance tracks discounts, promo codes, and shipping choices to
boost sales. Product Performance / Profit Margin evaluates product quality and profitability, and
Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) measures the total revenue generated by a customer over time.
Average Purchase Value (APV) calculates the average amount spent per transaction, and
Seasonal Purchase Patternsidentifies how purchases change with seasons for better planning.
Finally, Review Rating Distribution analyzes feedback to improve products and customer
